		Do you want to host a lottery or drawing? At Bitcoin Beacon, you can enter how you want your lottery to be designed and when you want the results to be released. We'll send you a file with all the information about your drawing, and when the time comes for the results we'll use the Bitcoin blockchain to pick your results, truly at random!
